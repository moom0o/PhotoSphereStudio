                <li><strong>Information from Google Sign-In:</strong> When you sign in with your Google Account, we receive a unique <strong>Google Account ID</strong>. This ID is used to associate your account with the images you upload.</li>

                <li><strong>User-Uploaded Content:</strong> We <strong>process</strong> the images (and their associated metadata, like GPS location) that you choose to upload through our Service for the sole purpose of publishing them to Google. <strong>We do not store the image files on our servers.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Database Information (With Your Consent):</strong> When you upload an image, you have an option via a checkbox labeled <strong>"Publish url as a marker to this website's map?"</strong>.

            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for specific purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Provide the Core Service:</strong> We use your Google Account ID to link your account to your uploads. We process the images you provide to <strong>upload, manage, and publish them to Google Street View</strong> on your behalf. This action is initiated by you and requires your explicit authorization through the Google API.</li>
                <li><strong>To Display Markers on Our Map:</strong> If you consent by leaving the <strong>"Publish url as a marker to this website's map?"</strong> checkbox enabled, we use the stored image URLs and GPS coordinates to display your published images as markers on the <code>maps.moomoo.me</code> public map for other users to see.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is only shared in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Google:</strong> The core function of our Service is to publish your images to Google Street View. Therefore, any images you upload are shared directly with <strong>Google</strong> to be published on their platform. These images and their management are subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Publicly on Our Map (With Your Consent):</strong> If you opt-in by enabling the checkbox, the resulting image URLs and their location coordinates will be used to publicly display a marker on our map.</li>
                <li><strong>With Third Parties:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your Google Account ID or any other personal information with any third parties.</li>

            <p>Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <strong>Google API Services User Data Policy</strong>, including the Limited Use requirements.

            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the limited information we store.

                <li><strong>Managing Your Images:</strong> The images you upload are managed through your Google Street View account. You can view, manage, or delete your published images directly through Google's services. Deleting an image from Google Street View will result in a broken link on our map.</li>
                <li><strong>Removing Your Markers:</strong> If you have allowed your image URLs and coordinates to be published to our map and wish to have them removed from our database, please contact us at the email address below.</li>
